# Rejouice Website Clone

This project is a clone of the [Rejouice](https://www.rejouice.com/) website, built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and GSAP for animations. It replicates the original website's interactive features, providing an opportunity to practice advanced web development and animation techniques.

## How to Run the Project

### Steps to Run Locally

**Clone the repository**:
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/rejouice-clone.git

## Overview

This project is a faithful reproduction of the Rejouice website, focusing on creating an interactive and visually appealing experience with text animations, cursor effects, and seamless transitions. The website includes:

- Engaging animations and visual effects.
- Custom interactive cursor.
- SVG animations for fluid, dynamic elements.
- An infinite autoplay swiper carousel.

## Features

- Text Animations: Smooth text reveal and transitions using GSAP.
- Custom Cursor: A custom-designed cursor that changes its style based on hover interactions.
- SVG Animations: Vector graphics with animations that bring the design to life.
- Infinite Autoplay Carousel: A continuous, looped carousel powered by Swiper.js for seamless scrolling of content.
  
## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: For structuring the content on the webpage.
- **CSS3**: For styling, flexbox layout, and animations.
- **JavaScript**: For handling dynamic behavior and DOM manipulation.
- **GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform)**: To handle advanced animations like text reveals and scroll animations.
- **Swiper.js**: For implementing the infinite autoplay carousel.

## Challenges Faced

While working on this project, some of the main challenges I encountered were:

- **Precise Animations**: Replicating the smooth, complex animations of the original website using GSAP.
- **Custom Cursor Interaction**: Implementing a custom cursor that reacts to user interactions across the website.
- **Infinite Carousel**: Ensuring a smooth, continuous loop in the carousel with autoplay features.

## Lessons Learned

- **Mastering GSAP**: Gained confidence in using GSAP for a wide range of animations, from text reveals to scroll-triggered animations.
- **SVG Animations**: Developed a deeper understanding of animating SVGs for web projects.
- **Swiper.js**: Learned how to implement a robust, infinite autoplay carousel with Swiper.js.

## Future Improvements

- **Enhanced Performance**: Further optimization of animations and code to improve performance, especially on mobile devices.
- CSS Optimizations: Further refinements in CSS to improve performance.
- Responsive Design
